## Research Foci
Below are the main research topics for the KASTLE lab. Current, past, and possible independent studies or research project opportunities are listed below each topic. **We are currently welcoming [Independent Studies](./recruiting.md) and Master's Theses pertaining to the below topics listed as "OPEN".**

Helpful acronyms:
* KG: Knowledge graph
* LLM: Large language model
* ACE: Attempto Controlled English

### Human-Centric Knowledge Engineering
Generally pertaining to the methodologies for developing of knowledge graphs, data integration, and ontology alignment, using human action.
* Knowledge Engineering through Prompt Engineering **(OPEN)** -- This research will involve mining LLMs for knowledge through prompts. For example, co-reference resolution or ontology alignment.
* Using LLMs for KG Construction **(OPEN)** -- This research will involve the construction of a KG schema through ODP-based methods.
* Topics in Modular Ontology Design **(OPEN)** -- This research might be the development of new ontology design patterns.

### Automated Knowledge Engineering
Generally pertaining to the development of tools, frameworks, and methods for automatically constructing ontologies, as well as conducting data integration, semantic harmonization, schema alignment, and visualization.
* Exploring Lexico-syntactic Patterns **(OPEN)** -- This research avenue pertains to understanding how lexico-syntactic patterns might empower LLMs to use graph-based data.
* Dynamically Creating KG Views from Module Metadata (Antrea Christou)

### Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Graphs
Generally pertaining to the extraction of formal knowledge from unstructured natural language, which is subsequently used to inform downstream tasks.
* [KG-powered Chat Bot](https://github.com/kastle-lab/kg-chatbot) (Anmol Saini)
* Connecting Multiple Latent Spaces through Fixed-Points **(OPEN)** -- This research avenue will seek to unify latent spaces generated over natural language and KGs.
* Fine-tuning an LLM to output ACE **(OPEN)**

### Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence
Generally pertaining to the combination of symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning with the power of neural learning systems. These topics tend to bridge between many categories.
* Investigation of Hidden Layer Node Activations in NL-KG Concurrent Systems **(OPEN)**
* Understanding the Impact of Graph Structure on KG Embeddings **(Brandon Dave)**
* Semantically Composable Glyphs for Representing AI Systems **(Alexis Ellis)**

### Open Science
Generally pertaining to methods where knowledge graphs and semantic technologies are used to promote open science, improve reproducibility and replicability, discovery of long-tail data.
* Meta-epistemology: A Model for Understanding Knowledge Gaps (OPEN) 

### Effective Pedagogy
Generally pertaining to the methods for effective pedagogy of computer science, data science, knowledge graphs, Semantic Web, and knowledge engineering. Generally, this involves the following resources.
* [The PRAXIS Intiative](https://the-praxis-initiative.org/) 
* [The Open KG Curriculum](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum/)
* [The Education Gateway for the Proto-OKN](https://edugate.cs.wright.edu/)

There is only a single topic, but it is quite variable, where contributing some set of articles based on interest could constitute an independent study.
* Building Curriculum for Knowledge Engineering (OPEN)
