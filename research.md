### Requesting an Independent Study
Please note that if you are interested in an independent study, the selected topic for the IS will pertain to one of KASTLE Lab's research foci. An independent study will always consist of a kick-off meeting at the start of the semester where we outline the specific trajectory of the course plan. It will be followed by 10 updates over the course of the semester where you will update progress on the particular topic. A final report will be due at the end of the semester.

Please ask if I have capacity to oversee an independent study before completing the below steps.

1. Acquire the [Graduate Consent form](https://engineering-computer-science.wright.edu/computer-science-and-engineering/forms-and-documents)
2. Fill out your personal information
3. Unless you otherwise have an exception, this IS will be only three credit hours.
4. Indicate which independent study level this is.
5. Propose an initial topic (we can iterate on this)
6. Deliverables: Written Report (1), Oral Report (10).
7. Method of Evaluation: Review of Deliverables
8. Grading Method: Letter grade
9. Provide me the document and I will fill out the course plan and sign.
