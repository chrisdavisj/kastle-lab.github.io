# Welcome to the KASTLE Lab
The Knowledge and Semantic Technologies (KASTLE) Laboratory was founded in 2022 at Wright State University by Dr. Cogan Shimizu.

KASTLE Lab's purpose is to
* develop fundamental advances in knowledge engineering, especially as they pertain to knowledge graphs;
* explore the intersection between knowledge engineering, domain science, and machine/deep learning for the purpose of accelerating science and promoting data discovery and transdisciplinary research;
* understand the bridge between human-conceptualization and machine-encoding to better align and design AI systems; and
* advance the state of open curriculum in knowledge engineering and semantic technologies.
